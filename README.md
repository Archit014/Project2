# What the project does.
It is an auction site that can be used to put an auction on the product the user wants to sell. Whoever bids the highest on the product, after the product owner closes the listing wins the item. 

# Why the project is useful
IITH students constantly want to sell their products which they don't want and they keep mailing for the products which creates a problem of spamming. 
This auction site will help the students to put their products on auction and interested users can buy them.

# How users can get started with the project
Users first have to register themselves for an account. Once registered, they can see a page of active listings and a button to view the closed listings page. Clicking on the view page will lead the user to the listing page for that particular item.
The page shows all the details about the listing, including the description, starting bid, current bid, seller name, category, status, and the comments made on that listing.
If the user who has not placed the listing visits the page of the particular listing, they are provided with option to place a bid and write a comment about the product. The bid placed should be higher than the current bid on the product.
The current bid may show nothing, if no bid has been placed till now, then the user must place a bid greater than the starting bid. Once pressed submit the comments and the bid reflects on the listing page. The user can also add the listing item to their watchlist.
They can see their watchlist by clicking on the watchlist button. The users can also see all the categories of products available for the auction by clicking on the categories button. The categories will show the list of all the categories available for listing,
clicking on a specific category will take the user to a page displaying all the listings in that category. Finally, the user can also create a new listing item, by clicking on create listing. It takes the user to a form page where the user has to type in the required fields
and submit the form, and the new listing will appear on the active listing page. If the user now clicks on the newly created listing page, it will have an option to close the current listing, closing the listing will make the user with with highest bid win the auction.

# Where users can get help with your project
The users will get the advantage of selling their product not via mail and worrying about spamming but rather getting a site where they can put bids on their item and interested users can buy them. It is convenient for both the seller as well as the buyer.
